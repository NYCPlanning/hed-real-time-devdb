# REAL TIME DEVDB

## About

On March 27, 2020 NYS issued a ban on all nonessential construction in 
effort to contain Covid-19. Since this time, the definition of [**essential**](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/essential_vs_non-essential.pdf) has widened 
somewhat but reductions in building application and permit activity are still apparent. 
This tracker displays weekly data [**updates**](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Job-Application-Filings/ic3t-wcy2) from the Department of Buildings, showing major 
construction (new buildings, major alterations, and demolitions) at three important 
milestones (application filed, permit issued, and certificate of occupancy issued).
